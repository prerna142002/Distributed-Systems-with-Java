A distributed system is a system of several processes, running on different computers communicating with each other through the network and sharing a state or working together to achieve a goal.

When we launch an application the OS creates an instance of it in the memory
Isolated from even the same application.

Intercommunication happens through the File System - Not a distributed system as they are still running on the same machine and we cannot do more than the capability of the machine.
